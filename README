Placeholder README:

example use:

in case you use "spotify" but a friend uses "apple music", you can
still share songs/albums/artists with your friend using said service

you can paste a music link from a supported streaming service and
it would return a webpage link containing equivalent links on other
services to share with your friend, becoming a fully "Agnostic"
music link share service.
